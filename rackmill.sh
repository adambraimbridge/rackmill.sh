# Audit apt sources to enforce canonical configuration.

# This function enforces rules for canonical APT source files for both Ubuntu and Debian:
#
# Ubuntu:
#   - For Ubuntu 23.04 and earlier: /etc/apt/sources.list
#   - For Ubuntu 23.10 and newer:   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources (deb822 format)
#
# Debian:
#   - For Debian 9-11: /etc/apt/sources.list
#   - For Debian 12+:  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources (deb822 format)
#
# For deb822 format (Ubuntu 23.10+ or Debian 12+):
#   - The canonical source file is /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources (Ubuntu) or debian.sources (Debian).
#   - /etc/apt/sources.list may exist by default, but should not contain any deb sources.
#   - The script does NOT error if /etc/apt/sources.list exists, but will error if it contains any deb lines.
#   - The script will echo the contents of the canonical file and prompt the operator to review & confirm.
#
# For classic format (Ubuntu 23.04 and earlier, or Debian 9-11):
#   - The canonical source file is /etc/apt/sources.list (classic format).
#   - The script compares the normalized deb lines to the expected canonical configuration.
#
# In all cases:
#   - If any other .list or .sources files are present in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, 
#       the script will display a list of offending files and prompt the operator 
#       to review & confirm before proceeding. 
#
# Outputs:
#   - For classic sources: sets up canonical sources for comparison and sets APT_SOURCES_CHANGES_REQUIRED=true if the current sources differ from the canonical configuration.
#   - For deb822 sources: displays the file contents and prompts the operator to confirm correctness interactively.
#   - If found, displays a list of offending files and prompt the operator to review & confirm before proceeding.
#   - Logs progress and audit results via step() calls.
#
# Exit status:
