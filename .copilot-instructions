# Rackmill Copilot Instructions

## Purpose
- Capture decisions and constraints so code-assist tools and collaborators follow the intended behavior.

# Copilot Instructions
Always consider the context of all files in the workspace.

## Principles for contributors and AI assistants

- Prefer minimal, clear, and fully valid code. Fewer lines that do the job correctly are better than verbose implementations.
- Comments: Use short section labels sparingly to help AI edits.
- Never introduce code that isn't 100% guaranteed valid in POSIX/bourne-compatible shells unless the change explicitly requires Bash features and the script declares `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Prioritize developer experience: pick readable names, small helper functions, and clear, actionable logging. Avoid clever one-liners that obscure intent.
- When in doubt, prefer simple, explicit checks and safe defaults over clever shortcuts.

## Key decisions and constraints

- Hostname: The script intentionally sets the hostname to `rackmill` for branding and template consistency.
- Supported Ubuntu releases for Rackmill (reference list):
  - LTS Releases:
    - Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)
    - Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
  - Interim Releases:
    - Ubuntu 25.04 (Plucky Puffin)
  - Extended Security Maintenance (ESM):
    - Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa)
    - Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
    - Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
    - Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS (Trusty Tahr)

- Additional customizations: `rackmill.sh` Should remain baseline-only, and NOT be extended to apply template-specific customizations such as:
  - SSH key injection / default authorized_keys
  - Creation/configuration of default users
  - Custom cloud-init snippets
  - Additional branding files

## Coding and operational guidance

Shell style
- Keep `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`.
- Use the existing helper functions `section()` and `step()` for readable output.
- Keep color constants (GREEN, CYAN, RESET) and the simple logging style.

- APT sources and upgrades
  - Populate `/etc/apt/sources.list` with the correct mirrors for that release.
  - For template scripts that lock to a specific release (e.g., Xenial snapshot), do not enable distribution-upgrade to a newer release; only apply package updates within the release (`apt-get dist-upgrade` is acceptable for updates within the release but avoid `do-release-upgrade`).
  - Clear `/var/lib/apt/lists/*` before running `apt-get update` in templating scenarios.

- Upgrade-manager and notifications
  - The script currently hides the upgrade banner and holds `update-manager-core` and `update-notifier-common` â€” preserve this behavior for template images unless instructed otherwise.

- Timezone & locale
  - Default timezone: `Australia/Perth` for Rackmill templates
  - Locale: generate `en_AU.UTF-8` and set `LANG`/`LANGUAGE`/`LC_TIME` accordingly.

 - Safety checks
  - Keep the root UID check at the top: script should refuse to run unless run as root.

## Progress tracking
- Use `project-notes.md` to track decisions  and checklist updates.
- Keep `project-notes.md` authoritative for project status.
